A database is an organized collection of information stored on a computer or server. This information can include numerical, textual, graphical, and other types of data. Databases are used by organizations and businesses to store and access information efficiently and effectively. Database systems allow for the creation, updating, and deletion of data, as well as the ability to perform queries and data analysis to make informed decisions.
